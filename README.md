# Meteorite Landings Analysis 

This project aims to analyze global meteorite landings to uncover patterns in their distribution, composition, and temporal trends. Using NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset, we perform extensive data cleaning and visualization to gain insights into meteorite characteristics and their impact on Earth.

# Objectives
- Analyze the geographic distribution of meteorite landings
- Identify patterns and trends in meteorite composition
- Examine temporal trends in meteorite falls and possible correlations with other events.
  
# Dataset
Source: NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset

The dataset contains information about meteorite landings, including name, id, type, mass, fall date, latitude, longitude, and classification.

# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas - data manipulation
NumPy - numerical operations
Matplotlib and Seaborn - data visualization


# Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values by forward filling
- Converted 'year' column to datetime format
- Ensured latitude and longitude columns were numeric
- Dropped rows with missing latitude or longitude values

# Visualizations
Bar Charts: Distribution of meteorite types
